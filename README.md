# 最佳附魔顺序计算器（The Best Enchanting Sequence）
[Java Edition Only](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition)

## 简介
这是一个可以帮助你在附魔的时候轻松降低附魔成本的小程序。

+ 众所周知，在原版Minecraft中我们可以通过附魔台和铁砧给物品附魔，以增强它们的属性。但是，由于游戏设计限制，我们并不能轻易地打造出一件令我们满意的附魔属性强大的神器。尤其是当使用铁砧进行附魔的时候，不仅经验花费巨大，更棘手的是操作多次后还会由于过于昂贵而无法继续操作，若你没能把握住这个规律，你需要的附魔往往就不能全部实现。因此，本程序应运而生。你可以通过它轻易地计算出一条可行的低成本的路径来实现你想要的附魔，打造出你想要的神器。

注意：这个项目仍在开发中，功能尚未完善，但已经能用了。由于作者很快又要开学了，所以剩下的功能可能将要推迟到以后慢慢更新完善。如果你有什么建议或发现了BUG，请联系我或反馈到这里来，谢谢！

## Description
This is a small program that can help you easily reduce the cost of experiences when you are enchanting.
+ It is well known that in Vanilla Minecraft we can enchant items with enchanting tables and anvils to enhance their properties. However, due to game design limitations, it was not easy to forge a powerful artifact that satisfies us. Especially when enchant with anvil, not only does it will cost us a lot experiences, but it also can be too expensive to continue after multiple operations, and if you don't grasp this rule, you will not able to get all the enchantments you need. Therefore, this program comes into being. It allows you to easily figure out a low-cost path in its way to enchant all the enchantments you want as far as possible, building the artifact you want.

Notice: This project is still under development and not fully functional, but it works. Since the author will be back in school soon, the rest of the features may have to be put off until later. If you have any suggestions or found bugs, please contact me or feedback here, thank you!
